  Be nice. If you're sending too many requests too quickly, we'll send back a 503 error 
  code (server unavailable).

  You are limited to 5000 requests per hour per access_token or client_id 
  overall. Practically, this means you should (when possible) authenticate users so 
  that limits are well outside the reach of a given user.
