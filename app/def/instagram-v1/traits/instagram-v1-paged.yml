  Sometimes you just can't get enough. For this reason, we've provided a convenient way to access more data in 
  any request for sequential data. Simply call the url in the next_url parameter and we'll respond with the 
  next set of data.

    {
        ...
        "pagination": {
            "next_url": "https://api.instagram.com/v1/tags/puppy/media/recent?access_token=...&max_id=13872296",
            "next_max_id": "13872296"
        }
    }
    
  On views where pagination is present, we also support the "count" parameter. Simply set this to the number of
  items you'd like to receive. Note that the default values should be fine for most applications - but if you
  decide to increase this number there is a maximum value defined on each endpoint.
