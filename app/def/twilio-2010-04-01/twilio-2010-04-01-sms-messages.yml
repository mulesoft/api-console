    # Rate limiting

    You can queue as many messages as you like, however Twilio will only send 
    out SMS messages at a rate of one message per phone number per second. It 
    is not possible to adjust this rate, and it does not vary based on the 
    country in which your number is located.

    If you anticipate the need to send out a large number of messages 
    quickly (a time-limited promotion, for example) or at a rate greater than 
    one message per second, you can purchase additional numbers, increasing 
    your outbound capacity.

    Short codes are not subject to the same rate limits as long-code numbers 
    and may be a better option for you. Check out our short code FAQ or talk 
    to our sales team to determine what is best for you.

    # Handling SMS Replies

    By specifying an SMS URL for your SMS enabled Twilio phone number, Twilio 
    will make a request to your application to notify you when someone replies 
    to a message you send. Twilio's request and your corresponding response are 
    covered in the SMS portion of the TwiML documentation.

          description: |
            A Twilio phone number enabled for SMS. Only phone numbers or short 
            codes purchased from Twilio work here; you cannot (for example) spoof 
            SMS messages from your own cell phone number.
          required: yes
        To:
          type: string
          description: |
            The destination phone number. Format with a '+' and country code e.g., 
            +16175551212 (E.164 format). For 'To' numbers without a '+', Twilio 
            will use the same country code as the 'From' number. Twilio will also 
            attempt to handle locally formatted numbers for that country code (e.g. 
            (415) 555-1212 for US, 07400123456 for GB). If you are sending to a 
            different country than the 'From' number, you must include a '+' and 
            the country code to ensure proper delivery.
          required: yes
        Body:
          type: string

            The text of the message you want to send, limited to 160 characters.
          required: yes
        StatusCallback:
          type: string
          description: |
            A URL that Twilio will POST to when your message is processed. Twilio will 
            POST the SmsSid as well as SmsStatus=sent or SmsStatus=failed.
          required: no
        ApplicationSid:
          type: string
          description: |
            Twilio will POST SmsSid as well as SmsStatus=sent or SmsStatus=failed to the
             URL in the SmsStatusCallback property of this Application. If the 
             StatusCallback parameter above is also passed, the Application's 
             SmsStatusCallback parameter will take precedence.
