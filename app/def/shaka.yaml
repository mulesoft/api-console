  - title: Authentication
    content: Instagramâ€™s API uses the [OAuth 2.0 protocol](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-oauth-v2-12) for simple, but effective authentication and 
      authorization. OAuth 2.0 is much easier to use than previous schemes; developers can start using the Instagram API almost immediately. The one thing 
      to keep in mind is that all requests to the API must be made over SSL (https:// not http://)
