      description: |
        Returns the 20 most recent mentions (tweets containing a users's @screen_name)
        for the authenticating user.
        The timeline returned is the equivalent of the one seen when you view your
        mentions on twitter.com.
        This method can only return up to 800 tweets.
      queryParameters:
        count:
          description: |
            Specifies the number of tweets to try and retrieve, up to a maximum of
            200. The value of count is best thought of as a limit to the number of
            tweets to return because suspended or deleted content is removed after
            the count has been applied. We include retweets in the count, even if
            include_rts is not supplied. It is recommended you always send include_rts=1
            when using this API method.
          type: integer
          maximum: 200
        since_id:
          description: |
            Returns results with an ID greater than (that is, more recent than) the
            specified ID. There are limits to the number of Tweets which can be accessed
            through the API. If the limit of Tweets has occured since the since_id, the
            since_id will be forced to the oldest ID available.
          type: integer
        max_id:
          description: |
            Returns results with an ID less than (that is, older than) or equal to
            the specified ID.

        contributor_details:
          description: |
            This parameter enhances the contributors element of the status response
            to include the screen_name of the contributor. By default only the user_id
            of the contributor is included.

      description: |
        Returns a collection of the most recent Tweets posted by the user indicated
        by the screen_name or user_id parameters.
        User timelines belonging to protected users may only be requested when the
        authenticated user either "owns" the timeline or is an approved follower of
        the owner.
        The timeline returned is the equivalent of the one seen when you view a user's
        profile on twitter.com.
        This method can only return up to 3,200 of a user's most recent Tweets. Native
        retweets of other statuses by the user is included in this total, regardless
        of whether include_rts is set to false when requesting this resource.
      queryParameters:
        user_id:
          description: The ID of the user for whom to return results for.
          type: integer
        screen_name:
          description: The screen name of the user for whom to return results for.
          type: string
        since_id:
          description: |
            Returns results with an ID greater than (that is, more recent than) the
            specified ID. There are limits to the number of Tweets which can be accessed
            through the API. If the limit of Tweets has occured since the since_id, the
            since_id will be forced to the oldest ID available.
          type: integer
        count:
          description: |
            Specifies the number of tweets to try and retrieve, up to a maximum of
            200 per distinct request. The value of count is best thought of as a
            limit to the number of tweets to return because suspended or deleted
            content is removed after the count has been applied. We include retweets
            in the count, even if include_rts is not supplied. It is recommended you
            always send include_rts=1 when using this API method.
          type: integer
        max_id:
          description: |
            Returns results with an ID less than (that is, older than) or equal to
            the specified ID.
          type: integer
        contributor_details:
          description: |
            This parameter enhances the contributors element of the status response
            to include the screen_name of the contributor. By default only the user_id
            of the contributor is included.
          type: string
        exclude_replies:
          description: |
            This parameter will prevent replies from appearing in the returned timeline.
            Using exclude_replies with the count parameter will mean you will receive
            up-to count tweets - this is because the count parameter retrieves tha
            many tweets before filtering out retweets and replies. This parameter is
            only supported for JSON and XML responses.
          type: string
        include_rts:
          description: |
            When set to false, the timeline will strip any native retweets (though
            they will still count toward both the maximal length of the timeline
            and the slice selected by the count parameter). Note: If you're using
            the trim_user parameter in conjunction with include_rts, the retweets
            will still contain a full user object.

            Specifies the number of records to retrieve. Must be less than or equal
            to 200.
          type: integer
          maximum: 200
          default: 20
        since_id:
          description: |
            Returns results with an ID greater than (that is, more recent than) the
            specified ID. There are limits to the number of Tweets which can be accessed
            through the API. If the limit of Tweets has occured since the since_id, the
            since_id will be forced to the oldest ID available.
          type: integer
        max_id:
          description: |
            Returns results with an ID less than (that is, older than) or equal to
            the specified ID.
          type: integer
        exclude_replies:
          description: |
            This parameter will prevent replies from appearing in the returned timeline.
            Using exclude_replies with the count parameter will mean you will receive
            up-to count tweets - this is because the count parameter retrieves tha
            many tweets before filtering out retweets and replies. This parameter is
            only supported for JSON and XML responses.
          type: string
        contributor_details:
          description: |
            This parameter enhances the contributors element of the status response
            to include the screen_name of the contributor. By default only the user_id
            of the contributor is included.

        Returns a single Tweet, specified by the id parameter. The Tweet's author
        will also be embedded within the tweet.

        Extended description
        About Geo
        If there is no geotag for a status, then there will be an empty <geo/> or
        "geo" : {}. This can only be populated if the user has used the Geotagging
        API to send a statuses/update.
        The JSON response mostly uses conventions laid out in GeoJSON. Unfortunately,
        the coordinates that Twitter renders are reversed from the GeoJSON specification
        (GeoJSON specifies a longitude then a latitude, whereas we are currently
        representing it as a latitude then a longitude). Our JSON renders as:
        -------------
        "geo": { "type":"Point", "coordinates":[37.78029, -122.39697] }

        Contributors
        If there are no contributors for a Tweet, then there will be an empty or
        "contributors" : {}. This field will only be populated if the user has
        contributors enabled on his or her account -- this is a beta feature tha
        is not yet generally available to all.
        This object contains an array of user IDs for users who have contributed
        to this status (an example of a status that has been contributed to is this
        one). In practice, there is usually only one ID in this array. The JSON
        renders as such
        -------------
        "contributors":[8285392].

      description: |
        Updates the authenticating user's current status, also known as tweeting.
        To upload an image to accompany the tweet, use `POST statuses/update_with_media`.
        For each update attempt, the update text is compared with the authenticating
        user's recent tweets. Any attempt that would result in duplication will be
        blocked, resulting in a 403 error. Therefore, a user cannot submit the same
        status twice in a row.
        While not rate limited by the API a user is limited in the number of tweets
        they can create at a time. If the number of updates posted by the user reaches
        the current allowed limit this method will return an HTTP 403 error.

                There are some special commands in this field to be aware of. For instance,
                preceding a message with "D " or "M " and following it with a screen name
                can create a direct message to that user if the relationship allows for it.

        Updates the authenticating user's current status and attaches media for
        upload. In other words, it creates a Tweet with a picture attached.
        Unlike POST statuses/update, this method expects raw multipart data. Your
        POST request's Content-Type should be set to multipart/form-data with the
        media[] parameter
        The Tweet text will be rewritten to include the media URL(s), which will
        reduce the number of characters allowed in the Tweet text. If the URL(s)
        cannot be appended without text truncation, the tweet will be rejected and
        this method will return an HTTP 403 error.

        about the response format.
        While this endpoint allows a bit of customization for the final appearance
        of the embedded Tweet, be aware that the appearance of the rendered Tweet may
        change over time to be consistent with Twitter's Display Requirements. Do no
        rely on any class or id parameters to stay constant in the returned markup.

        Returns public statuses that match one or more filter predicates. Multiple
        parameters may be specified which allows most clients to use a single connection
        to the Streaming API. Both GET and POST requests are supported, but GET requests
        with too many parameters may cause the request to be rejected for excessive URL
        length. Use a POST request to avoid long URLs.
        The track, follow, and locations fields should be considered to be combined
        with an OR operator. track=foo&follow=1234 returns Tweets matching "foo" OR
        created by user 1234.
        The default access level allows up to 400 track keywords, 5,000 follow userids
        and 25 0.1-360 degree location boxes. If you need elevated access to the Streaming
        API, you should explore our partner providers of Twitter data here.
        Note: At least one predicate parameter (follow, locations, or track) must be specified.

          Specifies what type of search results you would prefer to receive. The
          current default is "mixed." Valid values include
           * mixed: Include both popular and real time results in the response.
           * recent: return only the most recent results in the response
           * popular: return only the most popular results in the response.

        description: |
          Returns tweets generated before the given date. Date should be formatted
          as YYYY-MM-DD. Keep in mind that the search index may not go back as far
          as the date you specify here.
        type: string
      since_id:
        description: |
          Returns results with an ID greater than (that is, more recent than) the
          specified ID. There are limits to the number of Tweets which can be
          accessed through the API. If the limit of Tweets has occured since the
          since_id, the since_id will be forced to the oldest ID available.
        type: integer
      max_id:
        description: |
          Returns results with an ID less than (that is, older than) or equal to
          the specified ID.
        type: integer
      callback:
        description: |
          If supplied, the response will use the JSONP format with a callback of
          the given name. The usefulness of this parameter is somewhat diminished
          by the requirement of authentication for requests to this endpoint.

# Direct messages
/direct_messages{mediaTypeExtension}:
  type: base
  get:
    is: [ nestedable ]
    description: |
      Returns the 20 most recent direct messages sent to the authenticating user.
      Includes detailed information about the sender and recipient user. You can
      request up to 200 direct messages per call, up to a maximum of 800 incoming DMs.
      Important: This method requires an access token with RWD (read, write & direc
      message) permissions. Consult The Application Permission Model for more
      information. (https://dev.twitter.com/docs/application-permission-model)
    queryParameters:
      since_id:
        description: |
          Returns results with an ID greater than (that is, more recent than) the
          specified ID. There are limits to the number of Tweets which can be
          accessed through the API. If the limit of Tweets has occured since the
          since_id, the since_id will be forced to the oldest ID available.
        type: integer
      max_id:
        description: |
          Returns results with an ID less than (that is, older than) or equal to
          the specified ID.
        type: integer
      count:
        description: |
          Specifies the number of direct messages to try and retrieve, up to a
          maximum of 200. The value of count is best thought of as a limit to the
          number of Tweets to return because suspended or deleted content is removed
          after the count has been applied.
        type: integer
        maximum: 200
      skip_status:

        Returns the 20 most recent direct messages sent by the authenticating user.
        Includes detailed information about the sender and recipient user. You can
        request up to 200 direct messages per call, up to a maximum of 800 outgoing DMs.
        Important: This method requires an access token with RWD (read, write &
        direct message) permissions. Consult The Application Permission Model for
        more information.

            Returns results with an ID greater than (that is, more recent than) the
            specified ID. There are limits to the number of Tweets which can be
            accessed through the API. If the limit of Tweets has occured since the
            since_id, the since_id will be forced to the oldest ID available.

            Specifies the number of direct messages to try and retrieve, up to a
            maximum of 200. The value of count is best thought of as a limit to the
            number of Tweets to return because suspended or deleted content is removed
            after the count has been applied.

        Returns a cursored collection of user IDs for every user the specified user
        is following (otherwise known as their "friends").
        At this time, results are ordered with the most recent following first - however,
        this ordering is subject to unannounced change and eventual consistency issues.
        Results are given in groups of 5,000 user IDs and multiple "pages" of results
        can be navigated through using the next_cursor value in subsequent requests.
        See Using cursors to navigate collections for more information.
        This method is especially powerful when used in conjunction with
        'GET users/lookup', a method that allows you to convert user IDs into full
        user objects in bulk.

            If no cursor is provided, a value of -1 will be assumed, which is the
            first "page."
            The response from the API will include a previous_cursor and next_cursor

            the number of results to return. When using the count parameter with this

            the same user's collection. Usage of this parameter is encouraged in
            environments where all 5,000 IDs constitutes too large of a response.

        Updates the authenticating user's profile image. Note that this method
        expects raw multipart data, not a URL to an image.
        This method asynchronously processes the uploaded file before updating the
        user's profile image URL. You can either update your local cache the nex
        time you request the user's information, or, at least 5 seconds after
        uploading the image, ask for the updated URL using GET users/show.

# Lists
/lists:
  /list{mediaTypeExtension}:
    type: base
    get:
      description: |
        Returns all lists the authenticating or specified user subscribes to, including
        their own. The user is specified using the user_id or screen_name parameters.
        If no user is given, the authenticating user is used.
        This method used to be GET lists in version 1.0 of the API and has been renamed
        for consistency with other call.
        A maximum of 100 results will be returned by this call. Subscribed lists are
        returned first, followed by owned lists. This means that if a user subscribes
        to 90 lists and owns 20 lists, this method returns 90 subscriptions and 10 owned
        lists. The reverse method returns owned lists first, so with reverse=true, 20
        owned lists and 80 subscriptions would be returned. If your goal is to obtain
        every list a user owns or subscribes to, use GET lists/ownerships and/or
        GET lists/subscriptions instead.
      queryParameters:
        user_id:
          description: |
            The ID of the user for whom to return results for. Helpful for
            disambiguating when a valid user ID is also a valid screen name.
          type: integer
        screen_name:
          description: |
            The screen name of the user for whom to return results for. Helpful for
            disambiguating when a valid screen name is also a user ID.
          type: string
        reverse:
          description: |
            Set this to true if you would like owned lists to be returned first. See

          Check if the specified user is a subscriber of the specified list. Returns
          the user if they are subscriber.
          Either a list_id or a slug is required. If providing a list_slug, an
          owner_screen_name or owner_id is also required.

            description: |
              You can identify a list by its slug instead of its numerical id. If
              you decide to do so, note that you'll also have to specify the lis
              owner using the owner_id or owner_screen_name parameters.

          Adds multiple members to a list, by specifying a comma-separated list of
          member ids or screen names. The authenticated user must own the list to be
          able to add members to it. Note that lists can't have more than 5,000 members,
          and you are limited to adding up to 100 members to a list at a time with this
          method.
          Please note that there can be issues with lists that rapidly remove and add
          memberships. Take care when using these methods such that you are not too
          rapidly switching between removals and adds on the same list.

        Removes multiple members from a list, by specifying a comma-separated lis
        of member ids or screen names. The authenticated user must own the list to
        be able to remove members from it. Note that lists can't have more than 500
        members, and you are limited to removing up to 100 members to a list at a
        time with this method.
        Please note that there can be issues with lists that rapidly remove and add
        memberships. Take care when using these methods such that you are not too
        rapidly switching between removals and adds on the same list.
        Either a list_id or a slug is required. If providing a list_slug, an
        owner_screen_name or owner_id is also required.

      description: |
        Given a latitude and a longitude, searches for up to 20 places that can be
        used as a place_id when updating a status.
        This request is an informative call and will deliver generalized results
        about geography.
      queryParameters:
        lat:
          description: |
            The latitude to search around. This parameter will be ignored unless i
            is inside the range -90.0 to +90.0 (North is positive) inclusive. I
            will also be ignored if there isn't a corresponding long parameter.

          minimum: -90
          required: true
        long:
          description: |
            The longitude to search around. The valid ranges for longitude is -180.0
            to +180.0 (East is positive) inclusive. This parameter will be ignored
            if outside that range, if it is not a number, if geo_enabled is disabled,
            or if there not a corresponding lat parameter.

        accuracy:
          description: |
            A hint on the "region" in which to search. If a number, then this is a
            radius in meters, but it can also take a string that is suffixed with
            ft to specify feet. If this is not passed in, then it is assumed to be
            0m. If coming from a device, in practice, this value is whatever accuracy
            the device has measuring its location (whether it be coming from a GPS,
            WiFi triangulation, etc.).

            provided for the request neighborhood is assumed.
            Setting this to city, for example, will find places which have a type of

            A hint as to the number of results to return. This does not guarantee
            that the number of results returned will equal max_results, but instead
            informs how many "nearby" results to return. Ideally, only pass in the
            number of places you intend to display to the user here.

  /search{mediaTypeExtension}:
    type: base
    get:
      description: |
        Search for places that can be attached to a statuses/update. Given a latitude
        and a longitude pair, an IP address, or a name, this request will return a
        list of all the valid places that can be used as the place_id when updating
        a status.
        Conceptually, a query can be made from the user's location, retrieve a lis
        of places, have the user validate the location he or she is at, and then
        send the ID of this location with a call to POST statuses/update.
        This is the recommended method to use find places that can be attached to
        statuses/update. Unlike GET geo/reverse_geocode which provides raw data
        access, this endpoint can potentially re-order places with regards to the
        user who is authenticated. This approach is also preferred for interactive
        place matching with the user.
      queryParameters:
        lat:
          description: |
            The latitude to search around. This parameter will be ignored unless i
            is inside the range -90.0 to +90.0 (North is positive) inclusive. I
            will also be ignored if there isn't a corresponding long parameter.
          type: number
          maximum: 90
          minimum: -90
        long:
          description: |
            The longitude to search around. The valid ranges for longitude is -180.0
            to +180.0 (East is positive) inclusive. This parameter will be ignored
            if outside that range, if it is not a number, if geo_enabled is disabled,
            or if there not a corresponding lat parameter.
          type: number
          maximum: 180
          minimum: -180
        query:
          description: |
            Free-form text to match against while executing a geo-based query, bes
            suited for finding nearby locations by name. Remember to URL encode the query.
          type: string
        ip:
          description: |
            An IP address. Used when attempting to fix geolocation based off of the
            user's IP address.
        granularity:
          description: |
            This is the minimal granularity of place types to return and must be one
            of: poi, neighborhood, city, admin or country. If no granularity is
            provided for the request neighborhood is assumed.
            Setting this to city, for example, will find places which have a type of
            city, admin or country.
          enum:
            - poi
            - neighborhood
            - city
            - admin
            - country
          default: neighborhood
        accuracy:
          description: |
            A hint on the "region" in which to search. If a number, then this is a
            radius in meters, but it can also take a string that is suffixed with
            ft to specify feet. If this is not passed in, then it is assumed to be
            0m. If coming from a device, in practice, this value is whatever accuracy
            the device has measuring its location (whether it be coming from a GPS,
            WiFi triangulation, etc.).
          type: string
        max_results:
          description: |
            A hint as to the number of results to return. This does not guarantee
            that the number of results returned will equal max_results, but instead
            informs how many "nearby" results to return. Ideally, only pass in the
            number of places you intend to display to the user here.
          type: integer
        contained_within:
          description: |
            This is the place_id which you would like to restrict the search results
            to. Setting this value means only places within the given place_id will
            be found.
            Specify a place_id. For example, to scope all results to places within
            "San Francisco, CA USA", you would specify a place_id of "5a110d312052166f"
          type: string

        ? "attribute:street_address"
        :
          description: |
            This parameter searches for places which have this given street address.

    get:
      description: |
        Locates places near the given coordinates which are similar in name.
        Conceptually you would use this method to get a list of known places to choose from first. Then, if the desired place doesn't exist, make a request to POST geo/place to create a new one.
        The token contained in the response is the token needed to be able to create a new place.
      queryParameters:
        lat:
          description: |
            The latitude to search around. This parameter will be ignored unless i
            is inside the range -90.0 to +90.0 (North is positive) inclusive. I
            will also be ignored if there isn't a corresponding long parameter.
          type: number
          maximum: 90
          minimum: -90
          required: true
        long:
          description: |
            The longitude to search around. The valid ranges for longitude is -180.0
            to +180.0 (East is positive) inclusive. This parameter will be ignored
            if outside that range, if it is not a number, if geo_enabled is disabled,
            or if there not a corresponding lat parameter.
          type: number
          maximum: 180

        contained_within:
          description: |
            This is the place_id which you would like to restrict the search results
            to. Setting this value means only places within the given place_id will
            be found.
            Specify a place_id. For example, to scope all results to places within
            "San Francisco, CA USA", you would specify a place_id of "5a110d312052166f"

        Creates a new place object at the given latitude and longitude.
        Before creating a place you need to query GET geo/similar_places with the
        latitude, longitude and name of the place you wish to create. The query
        will return an array of places which are similar to the one you wish to
        create, and a token. If the place you wish to create isn't in the returned
        array you can use the token with this method to create a new one.

# Rate limits
/application/rate_limit_status{mediaTypeExtension}:

      Returns the current rate limits for methods belonging to the specified
      resource families.
      Each 1.1 API resource belongs to a "resource family" which is indicated in
      its method documentation. You can typically determine a method's resource
      family from the first component of the path after the resource version.
      This method responds with a map of methods belonging to the families specified
      by the resources parameter, the current remaining uses for each of those
      resources within the current rate limiting window, and its expiration time
      in epoch time. It also includes a rate_limit_context field that indicates
      the current access token or application-only authentication context.
      You may also issue requests to this method without any parameters to receive
      a map of all rate limited GET methods. If your application only uses a few
      of methods, please explicitly provide a resources parameter with the specified
      resource families you work with.
      When using app-only auth, this method's response indicates the app-only auth
      rate limiting context.
      Read more about REST API Rate Limiting in v1.1 and review the limits.
    queryParameters:
      resources:
        description: |
