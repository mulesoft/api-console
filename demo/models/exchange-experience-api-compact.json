Every time there is a new account or a change in an already existing one, the integration will poll for changes in the Salesforce source Org, publish the changes to a JMS topic and each subscriber will be responsible for updating the accounts in the target systems.\n\nThe application has two different batch jobs consuming this JMS topic, one for migrating the changes to the second Salesforce Org and the other one for migrating the changes to the Database. During the Process stage, each Salesforce account will be matched with an existing account in the Salesforce Org B or the Database by Name. The last step of the Process stage will group the accounts and create/update them in Salesforce Org B.\n\nFinally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.\n\nRead more about the Publish-Subscribe pattern in [this](http://blogs.mulesoft.com/introducing-pubsub-pattern-anypoint-templates/) blog post\n"

Every time there is a new account or a change in an already existing one, the integration will poll for changes in the Salesforce source Org, publish the changes to a JMS topic and each subscriber will be responsible for updating the accounts in the target systems.\n\nThe application has two different batch jobs consuming this JMS topic, one for migrating the changes to the second Salesforce Org and the other one for migrating the changes to the Database. During the Process stage, each Salesforce account will be matched with an existing account in the Salesforce Org B or the Database by Name. The last step of the Process stage will group the accounts and create/update them in Salesforce Org B.\n\nFinally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.\n\nRead more about the Publish-Subscribe pattern in [this](http://blogs.mulesoft.com/introducing-pubsub-pattern-anypoint-templates/) blog post\n"

Every time there is a new account or a change in an already existing one, the integration will poll for changes in the Salesforce source Org, publish the changes to a JMS topic and each subscriber will be responsible for updating the accounts in the target systems.\n\nThe application has two different batch jobs consuming this JMS topic, one for migrating the changes to the second Salesforce Org and the other one for migrating the changes to the Database. During the Process stage, each Salesforce account will be matched with an existing account in the Salesforce Org B or the Database by Name. The last step of the Process stage will group the accounts and create/update them in Salesforce Org B.\n\nFinally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.\n\nRead more about the Publish-Subscribe pattern in [this](http://blogs.mulesoft.com/introducing-pubsub-pattern-anypoint-templates/) blog post\n"

Every time there is a new account or a change in an already existing one, the integration will poll for changes in the Salesforce source Org, publish the changes to a JMS topic and each subscriber will be responsible for updating the accounts in the target systems.\n\nThe application has two different batch jobs consuming this JMS topic, one for migrating the changes to the second Salesforce Org and the other one for migrating the changes to the Database. During the Process stage, each Salesforce account will be matched with an existing account in the Salesforce Org B or the Database by Name. The last step of the Process stage will group the accounts and create/update them in Salesforce Org B.\n\nFinally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.\n\nRead more about the Publish-Subscribe pattern in [this](http://blogs.mulesoft.com/introducing-pubsub-pattern-anypoint-templates/) blog post\n"

Every time there is a new account or a change in an already existing one, the integration will poll for changes in the Salesforce source Org, publish the changes to a JMS topic and each subscriber will be responsible for updating the accounts in the target systems.\\n\\nThe application has two different batch jobs consuming this JMS topic, one for migrating the changes to the second Salesforce Org and the other one for migrating the changes to the Database. During the Process stage, each Salesforce account will be matched with an existing account in the Salesforce Org B or the Database by Name. The last step of the Process stage will group the accounts and create/update them in Salesforce Org B.\\n\\nFinally during the On Complete stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.\\n\\nRead more about the Publish-Subscribe pattern in <a href=\"http://blogs.mulesoft.com/introducing-pubsub-pattern-anypoint-templates/\">this</a> blog post\n</p>\n"
