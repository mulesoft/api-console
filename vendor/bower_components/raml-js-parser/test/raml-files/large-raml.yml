        Restores an item that has been moved to the trash. Default behavior is to
        restore the item to the folder it was in before it was moved to the trash.
        If that parent folder no longer exists or if there is now an item with the
        same name in that parent folder, the new parent folder and/or new name
        will need to be included in the request.

      Restores an item that has been moved to the trash. Default behavior is to
      restore the item to the folder it was in before it was moved to the trash.
      If that parent folder no longer exists or if there is now an item with the
      same name in that parent folder, the new parent folder and/or new name will
      need to be included in the request.

  /thumbnail.extension:
    type: base
    get:
      description: |
        Retrieves a thumbnail, or smaller image representation, of this file. Sizes
        of 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, and 256x256 can be returned. Currently thumbnails
        are only available in .png format and will only be generated for image file
        formats.
          There are three success cases that your application needs to account for:
        - If the thumbnail isn’t available yet, a 202 Accepted HTTP status will
        be returned, including a 'Location' header pointing to a placeholder
        graphic that can be used until the thumbnail is returned. A 'Retry-After'
        header will also be returned, indicating the time in seconds after which
        the thumbnail will be available. Your application should only attempt to
        get the thumbnail again after Retry-After time.
        - If Box can’t generate a thumbnail for this file type, a 302 Found
        response will be returned, redirecting to a placeholder graphic in the
        requested size for this particular file type.
        - If the thumbnail is available, a 200 OK response will be returned with
        the contents of the thumbnail in the body.
        - If Box is unable to generate a thumbnail for this particular file, a
        404 'Not Found' response will be returned with a code of
        preview_cannot_be_generated. If there are any bad parameters sent in, a
        standard 400 'Bad Request' will be returned.

      Used to retrieve the metadata about a shared item when only given a shared
      link. Because of varying permission levels for shared links, a password may
      be required to retrieve the shared item. Once the item has been retrieved,
      you can make API requests against the actual resource '/files/{id}' or
      '/folders/{id}' as long as the shared link and optional password are in the
      header.
      A full file or folder object is returned if the shared link is valid and the
      user has access to it. An error may be returned if the link is invalid, if a
      password is required, or if the user does not have access to the file.

      Long polling. To get real-time notification of activity in a Box account,
      use the long poll feature of the /events API. To do so, first call the
      /events API with an OPTIONS call to retrieve the long poll URL to use. Next,
      make a GET request to the provided URL to begin listening for events. If an
      event occurs within an account you are monitoring, you will receive a
      response with the value new_change. It's important to note that this response
      will not come with any other details, but should serve as a prompt to take
      further action such as calling the /events endpoint with your last known
      stream_position. After sending this response, the server will close the
      connection and you will need to repeat the long poll process to begin
      listening for events again.
        If no events occur for a period of time after you make the GET request to
      the long poll URL, you will receive a response with the value reconnect. When
      you receive this response, you'll make another OPTIONS call to the /events
      endpoint and repeat the long poll process.
